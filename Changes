    - many parms are no longer hard-coded, instead they 
      are obtained via $ui->parameters
    - BIG usability bonus - will now give intelligent error
      if an object is called as though it were a function.
        Ex. 
            # correct
            $snippet->parm->gender->value('F');
            # incorrect, gives nice error
            $snippet->parm->gender('F');
